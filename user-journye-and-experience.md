Exploring the World of Spotify:  

Discovering Spotify in 2019 while in India was transformative for my music experience. I cherished the freedom of a free Spotify account with occasional ads, but what truly impressed me was the ability to choose and play specific songs, a boon for an old-school hip-hop dancer like me. While finding high-quality, original hip-hop playlists was a challenge, Spotify came to my rescue, enriching my musical journey and introducing me to hidden gems. This experience was a revelation for someone who, in India, knew hip hop solely through music. 

Spotify Premium Transition: India to USA

Starting with Spotify's free account in India, I enjoyed its diverse music selection and regional content. However, my move to the USA in 2021 brought significant changes. The interface shifted, limted skips, & specific song selection vanished, with premium subscriptions being the norm.

To maintain my Spotify experience, I subscribed to Spotify Premium, unlocking an extensive old school Hip Hop music library, ad-free listening, superior audio quality, and curated playlists. The absence of ads improved my music enjoyment and dance routines as an old-school hip-hop dancer.

In summary, my shift to Spotify Premium in the USA broadened my musical horizons, improved my dance experience, and simplified content creation through Instagram integration.


Referral / Testimony :

Transitioning to Spotify Premium has been a revelation. It's not just about escaping ads; it's about total control. With Premium, I curate my soundtrack, enjoy crystal-clear audio, and dive into exclusive tracks. Offline downloads are a lifesaver, unlimited skips keep things fresh, and the global music library lets me explore.

My recommendation: switch to Spotify Premium and unlock a world of music tailored to you. It's the premium experience you deserve. Spotify offers promo codes and free trials to help you dive in.
